# Landing


Project Reflections:
Things I learned how to do by researching the solutions outside of the TOP curriculum:

- how to create transitions and the hover selector in css with transition-duration and :hover
- how to round the edges of boxes using border-radius:
- how to use the a:hover selector to change the color of links when you hover over them
- further practice of flex box and flex box conventions to create a landing page
- the ability to create an entire landing page from scratch
